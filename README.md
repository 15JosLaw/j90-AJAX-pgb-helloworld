Showing one way to get AJAX working on Phonegap Build



Like always I really do not know what I am doing, I just keep trying things until it works. 


PROBLEM 1: You must have a php enabled website for AJAX to work. 


PROBLEM 2: Apple does not like AJAX, since your app can be instantly changing is not fully contained. Not sure if they are allowing more of it now or just allowing certain developers to use AJAX


PROBLEM 3: Almost zero php security in these examples. This is just to get AJAX working, you really need to look into php security before using this.
