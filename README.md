Showing one way to get AJAX working on Phonegap Build




Like always I have no real idea what I am doing, I just seem to make things that work. 


PROBLEM: You must have a php enabled website for AJAX to work. 
2ND PROBLEM: Apple does not like AJAX, since your app can be instantly changing. Not sure if they are allowing more of it now or just allow certain developers.
